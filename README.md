# Intermediality in the Interwar Period – Essay Portfolio

This repository contains my academic work exploring intermediality during the interwar years. It includes revised essay sections, extended analyses, and examples from film, theatre, radio, visual art, and performance studies. The purpose of this repository is to document my research progress, store polished writing samples, and demonstrate my understanding of interdisciplinary cultural analysis.

## Goals
- Improve academic writing skills in English.
- Learn how to structure and revise essays using feedback.
- Develop a deeper understanding of intermediality as a concept.
- Analyse interwar cultural works across different media (film, theatre, visual art, radio).
- Practise using GitHub for organising academic portfolios.
- Gain confidence in presenting research in digital formats.
